Constitution for the United States of America amended fiVth Article has priority to be archived in both ASCII wordcounted and checksummed text and PDF/A-1 archive format for long term preservation then crptographicly signed and attested, garunteed to be veritable to corresponding printed replica documents.

NOTE: This is simply the best publication of Constitution for the United States of America. Other publications do not have this proper form of the constitution. When an amendment happens it should actually be amended by changing the physical source document of the Law. This never happened until I did it here. I appended The Bill of Rights into the constitution at the end of the fivth article, thus making an amended fiVth Article. The fiVth Article is the law governing amendings. 

The Symbols in the text are placeholders for Article. sections. These placeholders must be kept for using the text string to format it as the original and to format it for use in legal software. 

Roadmap: When these repos are Released you will have legal software of the full body of America's law in your hand and easy to access. 

Fact: The Bill of Rights was ratified by the same body in the same timeframe as the original constitution, unlike latter amendments.

Fact: The constitution auto-nullifies.

Extra Fact: After the Bill of Rights,  subsequent amendments complicate the intent of the constitution.

Fun Fact: Roger Sherman is the only man who signed all four founding Documents.

# amended fiVth Article
I appended The Bill of Rights into the constitution at the end of the fivth article. The bill of rights is a Joint Resolution passed by Congress on September 25, 1789. When looking at the bill of rights context clues suggest it was in another draft of the constitution which had rights enumerated therin or drafted for such a constitution. context clues suggest it was drafted for another draft of the constitution because nowhere are certain rights enumerated in the constitution which it was ratified to amend neither are they enumerated in the resolution, therefor to say "the enumeration of certain rights should not be construed to deny or dispairage others"[LINK] suggests the text was either a part of an earlier draft of the constitution which enumerated rights or applied to an earlier draft which enumerated rights. Suppose when that draft was not ratified then this text was selected for amendment pursuant the fivth article.
## Preexistence of rights 
It is imporatant to keep this amendment above any others because it proclaims that the rights therin and more rights preexist the law. Other laws do not claim to preexist but are created by the legislation. These rights and more preexist law.
 Fact: The bill of rights was ratified by the same body in the same timeframe as the original constitution, unlike latter amendments.
## Rightly dividing legislation
To rightly divide the status of legislation by congresses. Everything after the Federal Reserve Act is void. Void means it would be ratified by a congress foreign to the laws on which it claims to be founded. Everything before the Federal Reserve Act is part of a nullified constitution and because the bill of rights does proclaim rights to preexist law it remains applicable even as part of a nullified constitution.
All of the amendments before the Fed act would be optional after this point of nullification. Therefore partly because those amendments do not proclaim to preexist law I did not include them in the Constitution for the United States amended fiVth article. What I kept, in the Constitution for the United States amended fiVth article, is only what still applies, now.
## auto-nullification
Another fact for needing to keep the constitution is that it is needed to cite why it is nullified at the passing of a Federal Reserve Act. It auto-nullified because it does fail the guaruntee therein "The United States shall guaruntee a republican form of government"[LINK] this failed guaruntee which auto-nullifies the constitution applies, now.
The Constitution for the United States amended fiVth article is necesarry for two important facts first the preexistence of rights and next the auto-nullification of the constitution. Preexistence of rights and auto-nullification apply now, today.
